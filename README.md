Linear Regression Model: Salary Prediction Based on Years of Experience

This code builds a simple linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience in the given dataset. The dataset consists of the 'YearsExperience' and 'Salary' features. The code utilizes the sklearn library to construct a linear regression model and visualizes it.

Dataset Format:

YearsExperience: Years of experience of the employee.
Salary: Salary of the employee.
The code loads the dataset, separates the independent and dependent variables, then constructs a linear regression model and visualizes it. The results are presented as a graph illustrating the salary prediction based on years of experience.
